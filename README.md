# Redump-Dat-MIA-Fixer
This program adds "MIA" flags to any MIA discs in an inputted Redump DAT file.

You can either simply open the program and manually input a specific .dat file, or a folder containing any number of .dats, or you can drag & drop any combination of files and folders and the program will recursively search through all of them to identify and check any .dats within.

It won't automatically replace the inputted DATs with the updated ones, but you can select at the end whether you would like to do so.

So far I've only tested this program on Windows 10 and with Python 3.11.0, so I can't make any guarantees for other set-ups, but let me know if you encounter any issues and I'll see what I can do.
